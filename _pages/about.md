Dr. Kavindra Kandpal is a senior member of IEEE and has more than 12 years of teaching experience. He received his B.Tech. degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Kumaon Engineering College Dwarahat with distinction in 2010. In 2012, he received his M.Tech. degree in Microelectronics specialization from Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad. 

He was also awarded ‘Chancellor Gold Medal’ in the 7th convocation of IIITA. He joined the ECE department of IIIT-Allahabad as an Assistant Professor on 16th Dec. 2019. Before joining IIITA, he was associated with Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) Pilani, Pilani Campus, as a lecturer/ Assistant Professor in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, since Sep. 2013. He completed his Ph.D. program in the EEE department of BITS Pilani, in the area of oxide-based thin-film transistors in 2018. During his Ph.D., he worked closely with CSIR-CEERI Pilani for the experimental work related to TFT fabrication. 

His research interests include thin-film deposition, characterization, semiconductor devices, and display electronics. Apart from his interest in semiconductor devices, he also possesses strong analog, digital circuit design and layout design skills. For two successive years, 2017 and 2018, he has successfully guided teams comprising of undergraduate (B.E.) and postgraduate (M.E.) students from BITS Pilani and won Cadence India Design Contest. 

Currently, he is actively working in FinFET-based Memory, In-memory compute, CMOS Voltage reference circuit design, Analog and Digital VLSI Design, solid-state applications of topological insulators, device-to-circuit integrated design with applications ranging from display electronics, biosensors, and photodetectors. He has more than 75 research publications in peer-reviewed journals and international conferences. He is also a recipient of the IEEE Uttar Pradesh Section Young Professional Star Award for April 2021.
